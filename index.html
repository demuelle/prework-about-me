      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an instructor with Trilogy Education Services.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born at a hospital in Winfield, IL, but brought home to a house in Downers Grove.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Over the years, I've become very practiced at sitting on the couch and watching television.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Obviously, teaching people how to become software developers.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm in the West Beverly neighborhood of Chicago.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Building software provides quick, visible results. That quick feedback, and my enjoyment of solving logical and math problems makes software development a good fit for me.</p>
